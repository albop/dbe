## So what will we do ?

![](vain_diagram.jpg)

- Programming
- Econometrics / Machine Learning
- Talk about economics


## Data-based economics (1)

- Most economists use data all the time
  - to illustrate facts
  - to test theories

## What do economists do ?

::: {.incremental}

- import data
- clean the data
  - deal with heterogenous sources, missing data, abnormal observerations
  - super time consuming
  - we'll make this part easy for you
- describe the data (statistics), visualize it
- interpret it using a model
- present results

# Econometrics

## Econometricks

- An art invented by economists: $$\underbrace{y}_{\text{dependent variable}} = a \underbrace{x}_{\text{explanatory variable}} + b$$

. . . 

- Main challenge:
  - given dataset $(x_i, y_i)$
  - find $a$ while *controlling* for $b$
  - understand robustness of results
  - predict new values of $y$ for new values of $x$

## Econometricks: Example 1


Check out the following website: [How happy are you?](http://medialab.github.io/well-being-metrics/app/#/)

. . .

What is $x$ ? What is $y$ ?


## Econometricks: Example 2

$$\underbrace{y}_{\text{dependent variable}} = a \underbrace{x}_{\text{explanatory variable}} + b$$

::: {.incremental}

- A famous study:
  -  young men who go to war receive *in average* lower wages when they return than men who didn't go to war
  - ... is it because they skipped college?
  - ... or did they choose to go to war because they were less skilled for college?
- How to decide?

:::

## Econometricks: Example 2

$$\underbrace{y}_{\text{dependent variable}} = a \underbrace{x}_{\text{explanatory variable}} + b$$

::: {.incremental}

- How to decide?
  -  find a way to extract *causality*
  -  instrumental variables
  - This was worth a Nobel Prize! (D. Card, J. Angrist, G.W. Imbens)

## Big Data Era and Machine Learning (1) {auto-animate="true"}

- Data has become very abundant
- Large amounts of data of all kinds
  - structured (tables, ...)
  - unstructured (text, images, ...)
- Machine learning:
  - a set of powerful algorithms...
  - ... so powerful some call it *artificial intelligence*
    - they *learn* by processing data
  - ... to extract information and relations in large data sets


## Big Data Era and Machine Learning (2)  {auto-animate="true"}


- Machine learning:
  - a set of powerful algorithms...
  - ... so powerful some call it *artificial intelligence*
    - they *learn* by processing data
  - ... to extract information and relations in large data sets
  - ... 
- Comparison with econometrics
  - ML has it own, partially redundant, jargon
  - harder to study causality, standard deviation (precision)


## Machine Learning

$$\underbrace{y}_{\text{predicted variable}} = f( \underbrace{x}_{\text{feature}} , a)$$

- Challenge:
  - given dataset $(x_i, y_i)$
  - find $a$, that is find a nonlinear relationship between $a$ and $b$
  - predict new values of $y$ given new values of $x$

- What is the difference with econometrics?

Task: predict second and third columns from the first one.

Solution: deep learning with artificial neural nets


# Programming


## Why program in Python?

- Why learn and use Python?
- And not <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - R
  - SPSS
  - Stata
  - Matlab
  - C
  - Javascript
  - SQL
  - ...


## Because

Python is: __Easy__

![](python_kids.jpg){ height=100%}

## Because {auto-animate="true"}

Python is: __Free__

![](download_python.png){ height=80%}

## Because {auto-animate="true"}

Python is: __Popular__

![](tiobe.png)

([TIOBE Index](ttps://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/))


## Because  {auto-animate="true"}

Python has:

  - a lively community
  - lots of online ressources
  - libraries for virtually anything

  - The lingua Franca of Machine learning
    - All major machine learning softwares are written or interface with Python



## Why learn programming ? (1)

::: {.incremental}

- Researchers (econometricians or data scientists) spend 80% of their time writing code.
- Presentation (plots, interactive apps) is key and relies on
    - ... programming
-  Interaction with code becomes unavoidable in business environment
    - fixing the website
    - querying the database, ...
    - ...

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column}

- Worth investing a  bit of time to learn it
  - you can easily become an __expert__
  - and can do *anything*
- Plus it's fun

- We will "assume" everybody as some prior experience with Python
- Even though some of you have possibly never touched it
- We'll do some catchup today
- And count on you to find the resources to learn what you need when you need it
- Of course you can always ask questions

## Additional resources

Plenty of online resources to learn python/econometrics/machine learning

- [learnpython](learnpython.org) sponsored by [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- [quantecon](https://datascience.quantecon.org/): designed for economists, good examples of projects
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/): by Jake Van der Plas, very complete. Online free version.
- [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/), in R but very clear (beginner and advanced versions)
