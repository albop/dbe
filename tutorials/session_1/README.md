## Content

This catchup session is adapted from the Quantecon lectures on Datascience. It corresponds to the "Python Fundamentals".

* basics
* collections
* control\_flow
* functions


In class we will cover the two first topics. Later in the class, when we will use some more advanced features of Python, we will usually provide you with an example, and ask you to modify it.

 Nevertheless, if you feel uncomfortable, we strongly recommend you to come back here and go over the control\_flow and functions sections at your own pace.
